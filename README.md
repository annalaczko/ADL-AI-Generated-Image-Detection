# ADL - AI Generated Image Detection

 A project made for my Applied Deep Learning Course at TU Wien

## Chosen project

My chosen topic is Detecting AI-generated images. Nowadays, my Facebook feed is filled with AI-generated content. I am good at recognizing these, but most of my friends and family struggle with it. It's also quite scary to see all those people in the comments who are victims of the clickbait posts. 

I think it would be beneficial to use some tools to help users of these medias recognizing fake contents. Not only it would help detect fake information and stop the growing distrust against visual arts, but it would also support artist who are concerned about their livelihood taken away by the overuse of AI art. I am motivated to see how strong a model I can put together for detecting these images, and I want to familiarize myself with methods to help this process.
